# Hey, I’m Jakub 👋

I’m a **Software Technology Engineering student** at VIA University College and a developer who genuinely enjoys building things that *actually work*.  
I’m mostly backend-oriented, but I’m perfectly happy jumping across the stack when the problem demands it.

I like clean architecture, boring-but-reliable solutions, and code that’s easy to reason about six months later.

## 🧠 What I’m into

- Backend development with **C# / .NET**
- Distributed systems, APIs, and secure communication
- Turning vague requirements into concrete, working features
- Learning how things break — and how to prevent that next time
- Collaborating with people who care about what they build

I’m currently expanding into **DevOps, cloud-native tooling, and embedded systems**, because apparently I enjoy making my life harder :P

## 🔨 Tech I’ve worked with

**Languages**
- C#, Java, SQL, Python, PHP, TypeScript, JavaScript  
- Some Assembly  
- Currently learning **C for embedded systems**

**Backend**
- ASP.NET Core (.NET), Spring Boot, Node.js  
- REST APIs, gRPC, SignalR  
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB  

**Frontend**
- Blazor, React, Next.js  
- HTML, CSS, Sass  
*(I can make it work — designers still do it better)*

**Tools & Platforms**
- Git, GitHub, GitLab  
- CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes **(in progress)**  
- RabbitMQ, Power BI

## 🚀 Projects I’m proud of

### **HireFire – Distributed Job-Matching Platform**
A multi-service system with a strict separation of concerns:
- ASP.NET Core backend with REST & real-time communication
- Java Spring Boot data service
- gRPC communication over TLS
- PostgreSQL persistence
- Role-based access control and secure auth

Basically: a project where we tried to do things “the right way” — and learned a lot in the process.

## 🌍 A bit about me

- Based in Denmark 🇩🇰  
- Polish (Polska Gurom) 🇵🇱
- Caffeine is a requirement ☕
- Occasionally play League of Legends, which has taught me patience, teamwork, and when to mute chat.
